# This is the Amplify build specification file
# It defines how your project should be built and deployed
version: 1

# Environment variables section
# Here you can define both public and secret environment variables
env:
  # Secret variables that should be kept secure
  secrets:
    # API key for Groq, fetched from "secret" Amplify environment variables
    GROQ_API_KEY: ${/amplify/shared/d2nw56gcy11jy6/GROQ_API_KEY}

# Frontend configuration
# This section defines how your frontend application should be built
frontend:
  phases:
    # Commands to run before the main build process
    preBuild:
      commands:
        # Install project dependencies using npm
        # This ensures all required packages are available for the build
        - npm install
    # Commands to run during the main build process
    build:
      commands:
        # Run the build script defined in your package.json
        # This typically compiles and bundles your application
        - npm run build
  # Specify the artifacts to be deployed
  # Artifacts are the files that will be hosted on the Amplify hosting service
  artifacts:
    # The directory containing your built application files
    # 'dist' is common for many build tools, adjust if your build outputs to a different directory
    baseDirectory: dist
    # Files to include in the deployment
    # '**/*' means include all files and subdirectories
    files:
      - '**/*'
  # Cache configuration to speed up subsequent builds
  cache:
    paths:
      # Cache the node_modules directory
      # This can significantly speed up builds by reusing previously installed dependencies
      - node_modules/**/*
